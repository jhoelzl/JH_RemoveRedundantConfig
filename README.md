# JH_RemoveRedundantConfig
Magento Module that finds redundant entries in mysql table core_config_data.


If you have different config settings for default, website or store scope in Magento backend, maybe after some time you will end up in having obsolete and redundant settings for website and store scope that have the same value as the default scope. This module finds the duplicate entries and adds the ability to remove them.
